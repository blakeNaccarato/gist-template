# gist

`gist.py`: Short description of your gist.

Longer description of your gist. Name your gist and describe it briefly here. The `$` prefix sorts this file to the top of the gist and makes it show up as the name of the gist. Consider copying the short description above to the "description" field of the gist. Gists don't support folders, update `.gitignore` as needed to include/exclude more files to keep a flat layout. If your idea grows unwieldy, consider a full repository.
