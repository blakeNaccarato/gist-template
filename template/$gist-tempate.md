# `example.py`

Placeholder description.

## Usage

Download this Gist and run `setup.ps1` if you have [cross-platform PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell) installed, or equivalently in a terminal of your choice:

- Create a virtual environment, e.g. by running `py -m venv .venv` in Windows or on UNIX-like/MacOS systems [with the Python Launcher](https://python-launcher.app/) installed.
- Activate the virtual environment with `.venv/scripts/activate` on Windows or `.venv/bin/activate` on UNIX-like/MacOS systems.
- Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Now you can run Python scripts/modules in this Gist e.g. like `python example.py`. If you ran `setup.ps1`, you will also have some VSCode tooling and configurations. The [template `README.md`](../README.md) details the additional tooling available, as well as system setup.
